Welcome to CMR2, Cython version!

This version of CMR2 uses Cython, a package and language that combines python with c and lets you more directly incorporate the latter into your code.  

#######

#    To build:
#
#######

0.  Make sure you have the Cython package installed.  It comes automatically with Anaconda 3.5 or higher, but you might need to check for python 2.7.

1.  Enter directory where CMR2_pack_cyth.pyx and setup_cmr2.py are located.

2.  Type and run this line in your terminal:

python setup_cmr2.py build_ext —-inplace

This will compile your code.  

You will see some warning messages; as long as they are referring to things like numpy being deprecated or various functions not being needed, you can safely ignore these.  

You should now have a sub-directory called “build” and these two additional files:
CMR2_pack_cyth.cpython-35m-darwin.so 
CMR2_pack_cyth.c

3.  If step 2 went smoothly, you are all set!  You can import 
“CMR2_pack_cyth “ into any python code and proceed to use the CMR2 object and functions just as you would normally with any other python code or package.  

4.  Any time you want to make a change to the code, you will need to re-compile it, using steps 1 and 2, or your changes will not occur when you run.
