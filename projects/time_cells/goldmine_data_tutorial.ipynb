    "Notes on the time cell dataset, written Sept. 20, 2021. -Daniel\n",
    "\n",
    "__General notes.__\n",
    "- There are 10 subjects with 12 complete sessions of data, all epilepsy patients implanted with Behnke-Fried electrodes by Itzhak Fried at UCLA. These subjects are: U518 (2 sessions), U521, U526, U527, U530 (2 sessions), U532, U536, U537, U539, and U540. \n",
    "  - I collected 1.5 sessions of data on an 11th subject, U515 (coincidentally the first we tested), but do not recommend analyzing this data for reasons described in the testing notes.\n",
    "- During each ~1hr session, subjects first completed a 2-3 trial tutorial in a tutorial-only environment. Then they did 36 trials in the main maze, which is what I have used for all analyses.\n",
    "- There are 476 single- and multi-units across these 10 subjects\n",
    "  - Includes 109 hippocampal units, 204 units in the surrounding MTL (entorhinal cortex, amygdala, or parahippocampal gyrus), 75 lateral temporal lobe units, 69 prefrontal units, and 19 occipital or parietal units from a single subject (U518).\n",
    "- All subjects after U518 played the same game version, Goldmine 1.0.2. U518 played Goldmine 1.0 during their first session and Goldmine 1.0.1 during their second session.\n",
    "  - Changes between versions are minimal, with the most notable being that a slightly different environment was used in 1.0.2 than previously, although with the same basic maze shape.\n",
    "  - All changes from 1.0 to 1.0.1 are noted in the testing notes for U518/ses1, and all changes from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2 are noted in the testing notes for U521/ses0. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Raw data organization.__\n",
    "- Raw data are stored in /data7/goldmine/data, and all sessions follow the same directory structure, as follows.\n",
    "  - */data7/goldmine/data/subj/sess/events*: testing_notes.txt has all my notes on the session and is probably a good first document to read. events.jsonl file contains all behavioral events that are logged at gametime, along with sync pulse times that are used to align behavioral events to EEG (accurate within ~1ms). Sometimes there are image files in this dir that the UCLA research techs sent me, with electrode mapping info or their internal testing notes.\n",
    "  - */data7/goldmine/data/subj/sess/macro_lfps*: Macro EEG data, if it exists. There will also be a timestamps file.\n",
    "  - */data7/goldmine/data/subj/sess/micro_lfps*: Microwire EEG data, which follows the format CSC*.mat, where * = the channel number from 1 to however many micros were implanted. Each depth probe bundles 8 recording wires, so micros 1-8 are in the same region, 9-16 are in the same region, etc. anatleads.txt lists the loations of each micro in the brain, using UCLA's brain region acronyms. The first letter is always L or R for left and right, respectively. e.g. LAH = left anterior hippocampus. lfpTimeStamps_micro.mat contains the timestamps for the microwires, as logged by the EEG recording system.\n",
    "  - */data7/goldmine/data/subj/sess/spikes*: The wave_clus3 spike sorting algorithm (Chaure, Rey & Quiroga, J Neurophysiol 2018) is run on each microwire channel to yield automatic spike sorting results (/wave_clus3_autosort). Then I went through each channel and accepted, merged, or rejected each unit by hand (wave_clus3_sortbyhand). The latter contain the spiking data that I use in all analyses. I have included both single- and multi-units in wave_clus3_sortbyhand, but have not made a quantitative distinction between these.\n",
    "  - */data7/goldmine/data/subj/sess/sync*: sync_channel_micro.mat contains analog sync pulses with the same timestamps as the microwires. This file is used alongside synctimes in events.jsonl to align behavioral events to EEG.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Preprocessed data organization.__\n",
    "- Preprocessed data is stored in /data7/goldmine/analysis. The following files exist for each data session.\n",
    "  - */data7/goldmine/analysis*: subj_sess-events_formatted.pkl is created by events_preproc.format_events() and is basically just the events.jsonl dataframe after aligning times to EEG timestamps.  In practice you probably won't ever need to load this file. subj_sess-Events.pkl is loaded by events_proc.load_events() and explained in detail below. subj_sess-EventSpikes.pkl is loaded by time_bin_analysis.load_event_spikes() and also explained in the cells below.\n",
    "  - */data7/goldmine/spikes*: Contains one file for each spike-sorted single- or multi-unit. File name is like '{}_{}_CSC{}_unit{}-spikes.pkl'.format(subj, sess, chan, unit). Each file contains a pandas Series object with the region location ('hemroi') and a vector ('spike_times') that lists all spike times, in ms, aligned to the event times in analysis/events/subj_sess-Events.pkl dataframes. These files are created by spike_preproc.format_spikes(), and you can load the saved files with spike_preproc.load_spikes()."
